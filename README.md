# SpywarePython
A Simple Malware project in python that uses network hacking to infect computers, and sends data back to a host computer on the network using SSDP
The H4K3R File is the malware file, that would be put onto someones computer, The Server File is the file that runs on a computer that recives all the data.\
This is my First Malware project, so it has some flaws.
